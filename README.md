[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joppe/array.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joppe/array) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/joppe/array/badge.svg?branch=feature%2Fbased-on-new-boilerplate)](https://coveralls.io/github/joppe/array?branch=feature%2Fbased-on-new-boilerplate) [![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@apestaartje/array.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apestaartje/array)

This is a collection of array utility functions written in `TypeScript`. The compiled files and the declaration files 
are available in the `dist` folder. 
Each function is in it's own file, therefore if you want to use one specific function you don't need to import a whole
bunch of unwanted code.
